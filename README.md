# Minimum-Spanning-Tree
Code in C++ that implements Prim's, Kruskal via DFS' and Kruskal Union Find's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree given a graph in a txt file

As you can see on the txt files, this code will only work with graphs that start with a node 0, otherwise it'll not work.

The output after executing each function, will be the final cost of the MST, the compilation time and the vertices it took to find the MST
